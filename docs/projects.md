However, this number increased to 17 taxa with this project. 
The distribution of *Verbascum bombyciferum*, *V. thapsus* and *V. vacillans* in Thrace region and in Tekirdag province,
*V. banaticum*, *V. blattaria*, *V. densiflorum* and *V. ovalifolium* subsp. *thracicum* in 
Tekirdağ province has been demonstrated with this thesis for the first time. 
Although the distribution and habitat information of *V. orientale* subsp. *orientale* and *V. mucronatum* taxons given 
in the literature were utilized, existing distribution in Tekirdağ province could not be determined during the field studies.
