My work is not confined to conservation alone; it spans a broad spectrum of ecological studies,  including vital projects on wetland ecosystems, taxonomical revisions of plant species,  and the exploration of ethnobotanical knowledge.  This diversity in research highlights my versatility and deep-seated curiosity about the natural world.</p> <p> In the realm of wetlands,  my efforts are aimed at uncovering how these crucial ecosystems can be protected and restored in the face of environmental changes.  Through taxonomical revisions, I strive to clarify the identity and relationships of plant species,  a foundational step for effective conservation and ecological modeling.  My interest in ethnobotany allows me to delve into the traditional knowledge surrounding plant use,  fostering a greater understanding of human-plant interactions and their implications for biodiversity conservation.</p> <p> My scientific pursuits are augmented by a robust skill set in data science and software development,  with a proficiency in Python, R, and JavaScript.  I develop analytical tools and web applications that serve as bridges between technological innovation and ecological research,  facilitating data-driven insights into ecological phenomena and conservation strategies.</p> <p> Engaging in this interdisciplinary work,  I am committed to contributing to a deeper understanding of ecological dynamics, species preservation,  and the sustainable management of natural resources.  My goal is to merge scientific inquiry with technological advances to tackle ecological challenges,  promote biodiversity, and ensure the resilience of ecosystems against the backdrop of climate change.</p>"},{"location":"courses/","title":"Courses","text":""},{"location":"courses/#introduction-to-biodiversity-specimen-digitization","title":"Introduction to Biodiversity Specimen Digitization","text":"<ul> <li>Organization: University of Florida, USA (iDigBio)</li> <li>Date: 2023</li> </ul>"},{"location":"courses/#statistical-modeling-techniques-and-applications-in-natural-sciences","title":"Statistical modeling techniques and applications in natural sciences","text":"<ul> <li>Organization: Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (T\u00dcB\u0130TAK 2237)</li> <li>Date: 2020</li> <li>Course Code: 1129B371901447</li> </ul>"},{"location":"courses/#calculation-and-mapping-of-land-diversity-with-entropy-based-algorithms","title":"Calculation and mapping of land diversity with entropy-based algorithms","text":"<ul> <li>Organization: Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (T\u00dcB\u0130TAK 2237)</li> <li>Date: 2020</li> <li>Course Code: 1129B371800905</li> </ul>"},{"location":"courses/#hands-on-phylogenetics-theory-and-practice","title":"Hands on Phylogenetics: Theory and Practice","text":"<ul> <li>Organization: Tekirda\u011f Nam\u0131k Kemal University, T\u00fcrkiye</li> <li>Date: 2019</li> </ul>"},{"location":"cv/","title":"Og\u00fcn Demir","text":"<p> 0000-0002-5899-5050 demirogun Og\u00fcn Demir  :simple-linkedin: Og\u00fcn Demir</p>"},{"location":"cv/#contact","title":"Contact","text":"<ul> <li>Email: ogundemir8@gmail.com</li> <li>Phone: +90 542 536 5207</li> <li>Address: Tekirda\u011f Nam\u0131k Kemal University, Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Department of Biology, 59030, Tekirda\u011f, T\u00fcrkiye</li> </ul>"},{"location":"cv/#about-me","title":"About Me","text":"<p>I am a biologist with interests in plant taxonomy, systematics, and ecology.
